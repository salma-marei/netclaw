# netclaw-agent-memory Specification

Research: `docs/research/agent-patterns.md`,
`docs/research/dynamic-context-discovery.md` (§5 — deferred memory retrieval
decisions: keyword vs. vector search, embedding strategy, injection budgets)

## Purpose

Define agent personality (identity files), SQLite-first cross-session memory,
self-configuration through conversation, checkpoint-driven memory curation,
automatic pre-turn recall, and the standard configuration directory structure.
This capability makes Netclaw a persistent, context-aware agent rather than a
stateless chat endpoint.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Layered system prompt assembly

The system SHALL assemble session context from ordered layers: `SOUL.md`, the audience-appropriate embedded operating core followed by the deployment `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLING.md`, dynamic context layers (tool index, skill index, memory index), and session-specific context. The embedded operating core SHALL be labeled as higher-priority platform guidance, while runtime ACL and tool policy SHALL remain the authoritative security boundaries. The same deployment `AGENTS.md` SHALL apply to Personal, Team, and Public audiences. Identity files SHALL be read before each inbound turn so edits take effect on the next turn. Missing files SHALL be omitted without error; unexpected read failures SHALL be surfaced.

#### Scenario: Full layer assembly on an inbound turn

- **GIVEN** identity files exist at `~/.netclaw/identity/SOUL.md`, `~/.netclaw/identity/AGENTS.md`, and `~/.netclaw/identity/TOOLING.md`
- **WHEN** an inbound turn begins
- **THEN** the system prompt includes the audience-appropriate embedded operating core before the deployment `AGENTS.md`
- **AND** includes the remaining permitted identity and dynamic context layers in canonical order

#### Scenario: Deployment playbook applies to Public audience

- **GIVEN** a deployment `AGENTS.md` exists
- **WHEN** a Public-audience turn begins
- **THEN** the prompt contains the stripped embedded Public operating core
- **AND** contains the same deployment playbook used for Personal and Team audiences
- **AND** continues to suppress Public-ineligible tooling and project layers

#### Scenario: Identity edit takes effect on next turn

- **GIVEN** a session is active
- **WHEN** the deployment `AGENTS.md` is updated during a turn
- **THEN** the current model call is unchanged
- **AND** the next inbound turn rebuilds its prompt with the updated playbook

#### Scenario: Missing identity file does not prevent a turn

- **GIVEN** one or more optional identity files do not exist on disk
- **WHEN** an inbound turn begins
- **THEN** the system assembles the prompt from available layers
- **AND** the missing layer is omitted without error

### Requirement: Personality bootstrap via onboarding wizard

The system SHALL bootstrap agent personality and its deployment playbook through `netclaw init`. The wizard SHALL collect owner identity, write initial `SOUL.md` and `TOOLING.md`, and seed a minimal `AGENTS.md` playbook scaffold only when that file is absent. The post-init conversation SHALL refine personality and mission guidance using identity-file tools and the always-present embedded identity routing rules.

#### Scenario: Fresh init seeds identity files

- **GIVEN** a fresh install with no identity files
- **WHEN** the operator completes `netclaw init`
- **THEN** the wizard writes initial `SOUL.md` and `TOOLING.md`
- **AND** writes a minimal deployment mission scaffold to `AGENTS.md`

#### Scenario: Init preserves an existing playbook

- **GIVEN** `~/.netclaw/identity/AGENTS.md` already exists
- **WHEN** init or identity redo writes identity-owned files
- **THEN** the existing playbook remains byte-for-byte unchanged

### Requirement: Self-configuration through conversation

The system SHALL allow the agent to modify identity files (`SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLING.md`) and skill files (`~/.netclaw/skills/*.md`) through conversation using `file_read` and `file_write`. Always-present embedded guidance SHALL route personality and operator context to `SOUL.md`, deployment mission/workflows/skill-selection/review rules to `AGENTS.md`, and environment capabilities to `TOOLING.md`. The agent SHALL propose and obtain confirmation before changing mission guidance. The agent SHALL NOT place secrets, volatile entity data, ACL, or security policy in the deployment playbook and SHALL NOT have tools that directly modify `netclaw.json`, `secrets.json`, ACL, or security policy.

#### Scenario: Agent updates deployment mission

- **GIVEN** the operator asks to improve a recurring deployment workflow
- **WHEN** the agent has clarified the intended process and the operator confirms its proposal
- **THEN** the agent reads and updates `AGENTS.md` using identity-file tools
- **AND** reports that the change applies on the next inbound turn

#### Scenario: Agent routes operator context separately

- **GIVEN** the operator shares personal communication preferences while defining the mission
- **WHEN** the agent persists the confirmed onboarding results
- **THEN** it writes operator and personality context to `SOUL.md`
- **AND** writes mission and workflow guidance to `AGENTS.md`

#### Scenario: Agent attempts to modify ACL

- **GIVEN** the user asks the agent to update ACL rules through conversation
- **WHEN** the agent evaluates the request
- **THEN** the agent refuses the modification
- **AND** explains that ACL changes require CLI or direct operator configuration

### Requirement: Pre-compaction memory flush

The system SHALL replace the current single-step pre-compaction memory flush
with checkpoint-driven background memory curation. The session SHALL emit
durable memory checkpoints on eligible events including turn completion,
explicit memory requests, compaction boundaries, verified tool findings, and
accepted subagent findings. Compaction-related checkpoints SHALL be high
priority, but the user-facing turn SHALL wait only for durable checkpoint
enqueue acknowledgment, not for curator completion.

#### Scenario: Compaction boundary creates a high-priority checkpoint

- **GIVEN** a session is approaching or crossing the compaction threshold
- **WHEN** the session prepares to compact history
- **THEN** the system enqueues a high-priority memory checkpoint containing the
  relevant summary inputs
- **AND** compaction continues after checkpoint enqueue succeeds

#### Scenario: Checkpoint curation retries after failure

- **GIVEN** a checkpoint was enqueued successfully
- **WHEN** background curation fails or times out
- **THEN** the checkpoint remains pending with retry metadata
- **AND** durable memory is not partially committed

### Requirement: Standard configuration directory

The system SHALL use the configured Netclaw home as its standard data directory.
The memory subsystem SHALL use the single Netclaw SQLite database at
`NetclawPaths.SqliteDbPath`. That database SHALL be the source of truth for all
SQLite-backed production data. The system SHALL NOT create a separate memory
database or expose an independent database-path or persistence-provider setting.

#### Scenario: Netclaw database created on startup

- **GIVEN** the configured Netclaw home does not contain `netclaw.db`
- **WHEN** the Netclaw process starts with the redesigned memory subsystem
  enabled
- **THEN** the system creates `NetclawPaths.SqliteDbPath`
- **AND** the system initializes the memory schema in that database
- **AND** the daemon reports memory status as healthy when initialization
  succeeds

#### Scenario: Greenfield startup requires no legacy memory store

- **GIVEN** the configured Netclaw home contains no legacy memory store
- **WHEN** the redesigned memory subsystem starts for the first time
- **THEN** the system initializes successfully without any import step
- **AND** it uses the single Netclaw database as the durable memory substrate

### Requirement: Pluggable memory backend with 4-tool surface

The system SHALL use a local SQLite-backed structured memory substrate as
Netclaw's default and normative durable memory implementation. The frontline
model SHALL continue to see the explicit tools `find_memories`,
`get_memories`, `store_memory`, and `update_memory`, but those tools SHALL
operate over the SQLite memory graph and shared policy pipeline rather than
selecting between file-backed and Memorizer-backed primary providers. Legacy
provider modes SHALL NOT be required for MVP delivery.

#### Scenario: SQLite memory is the active default substrate

- **GIVEN** Netclaw starts with the redesigned memory system
- **WHEN** the daemon initializes the memory subsystem
- **THEN** the daemon uses the local SQLite memory database as the primary
  durable memory store
- **AND** explicit memory tools route to that store

#### Scenario: MVP does not depend on legacy provider compatibility

- **GIVEN** the redesigned memory subsystem is being delivered for greenfield
  MVP use
- **WHEN** implementation scope is evaluated
- **THEN** SQLite-backed memory and the explicit tool surface are sufficient for
  completion
- **AND** legacy provider-mode bridging may be omitted or deferred to a future
  change

### Requirement: Two-phase memory retrieval

Memory retrieval SHALL run in two modes: automatic pre-turn recall and explicit
two-phase retrieval. Automatic recall SHALL happen before each user-facing
model turn and SHALL inject a bounded recall bundle derived from the structured
memory graph. Explicit retrieval SHALL continue to use `find_memories` for
lightweight search and `get_memories` for full hydration when manual follow-up
is needed. Automatic recall is the primary retrieval path; explicit retrieval
is a deliberate manual-control path.

#### Scenario: Automatic recall runs before a user-facing turn

- **GIVEN** a user sends a new message into an existing or new session
- **WHEN** the session prepares the next model call
- **THEN** the system runs a policy-aware automatic recall query against durable
  memory
- **AND** injects a bounded recall bundle before the model sees the turn

#### Scenario: Explicit two-phase retrieval remains available

- **GIVEN** the automatic recall bundle was insufficient or the user explicitly
  asks what Netclaw remembers
- **WHEN** the frontline model calls `find_memories`
- **THEN** it receives lightweight results suitable for selection
- **AND** can call `get_memories` to fetch full memory bodies only for the
  selected items

#### Scenario: Routine turn relies on automatic recall first

- **GIVEN** a normal user-facing turn begins
- **WHEN** the automatic recall bundle already provides the relevant durable
  context
- **THEN** the frontline model does not need to call explicit retrieval tools by
  default
- **AND** proceeds using the system-managed recall bundle

### Requirement: Memory context layer per backend

The memory context layer SHALL explain that durable recall is automatic by
default and that explicit memory tools are reserved for deliberate manual
search, save, and correction workflows. The layer SHALL surface degraded memory
status when automatic recall or durable persistence is unavailable. It SHALL no
longer teach the model that backend selection is part of normal memory usage,
and it SHALL explicitly tell the frontline model not to call write tools
reflexively on every turn.

#### Scenario: Context layer teaches automatic recall first

- **GIVEN** the redesigned memory subsystem is healthy
- **WHEN** a session prompt is assembled
- **THEN** the memory context layer explains that Netclaw automatically recalls
  durable memory before each turn
- **AND** reserves explicit memory tools for deliberate memory operations

#### Scenario: Context layer distinguishes store and update usage

- **GIVEN** the redesigned memory subsystem is healthy
- **WHEN** memory guidance is injected into the session prompt
- **THEN** the guidance says `store_memory` is for deliberate save/remember
  actions
- **AND** the guidance says `update_memory` is for correction, supersede,
  tombstone, or metadata changes to existing memory

#### Scenario: Context layer reports degraded memory state

- **GIVEN** the memory database is unavailable or recall has been disabled due
  to an operational fault
- **WHEN** a session prompt is assembled
- **THEN** the memory context layer reports degraded memory status
- **AND** does not claim that durable recall is functioning normally

### Requirement: Hierarchical anchor graph memory model

The system SHALL model durable memory around anchors/entities with optional
parent-child hierarchy and typed graph edges. Anchors SHALL support containment
(`project` -> `repo` -> `service`) and non-hierarchical relationships
(`related_to`, `depends_on`, `owned_by`) so recall can expand around the
relevant entity without flattening all memory into note blobs.

#### Scenario: Recall traverses anchor hierarchy

- **GIVEN** a project anchor contains repository and service child anchors
- **WHEN** a user asks about the project at the parent level
- **THEN** the recall pipeline MAY retrieve child-scoped memory through the
  hierarchy
- **AND** only items allowed by policy are injected into the recall bundle

### Requirement: Durable memory policy envelope

Every durable anchor, document, record, and edge SHALL carry policy metadata
including `audience`, `sensitivity`, `recallMode`, `confidence`, `freshness`,
and `updateSemantics`. The write path SHALL assign or reject these values
before persistence, and the recall path SHALL filter by them before prompt
injection.

#### Scenario: Sensitive memory is blocked from auto recall

- **GIVEN** a stored memory item is marked `audience=personal`,
  `sensitivity=secret`, and `recallMode=manual`
- **WHEN** a session whose audience does not include `personal` runs automatic
  pre-turn recall
- **THEN** the item is excluded from the automatic recall bundle
- **AND** it remains available only to explicit authorized workflows if policy
  allows

### Requirement: Documents versus records semantics

The system SHALL distinguish mutable `documents` from immutable `records`.
Documents SHALL represent living, mergeable knowledge that can be updated in
place with version history. Records SHALL represent time-bound observations that
are immutable once written and can only be superseded, expired, or tombstoned
by subsequent operations.

#### Scenario: Preference update modifies a document

- **GIVEN** an operator preference is stored as a document on a `person` anchor
- **WHEN** the operator corrects that preference later
- **THEN** the system updates the document according to its merge semantics
- **AND** preserves version lineage for auditability

#### Scenario: Historical event becomes a superseded record

- **GIVEN** a host IP change is stored as a record on a `host` anchor
- **WHEN** a newer verified IP change is persisted
- **THEN** the new fact is stored as a new record
- **AND** the older record is marked as superseded rather than overwritten

### Requirement: Rules-first candidate extraction

The system SHALL run deterministic rules before any curator LLM call when
converting checkpoints into durable memory. These rules SHALL reject ephemeral
chatter, duplicates, policy-violating content, and low-confidence candidates
before invoking the curator.

#### Scenario: Trivial chatter is filtered before curation

- **GIVEN** a checkpoint contains both stable project facts and casual
  acknowledgments
- **WHEN** rules-first extraction runs
- **THEN** the stable facts survive as candidates
- **AND** the casual acknowledgments are dropped without calling the curator for
  them

### Requirement: Automatic pre-turn recall

The system SHALL execute automatic recall before each user-facing model turn
using the latest user message, recent session context, active anchors, and
policy scope. Automatic recall SHALL be bounded by a latency budget and SHALL
degrade safely when the memory substrate is unavailable.

#### Scenario: Recall completes within budget

- **GIVEN** the memory substrate is healthy
- **WHEN** a new turn begins
- **THEN** the session retrieves and injects a bounded recall bundle before the
  model call
- **AND** the recall operation completes within the configured time budget or
  degrades safely

#### Scenario: Recall failure degrades without blocking the turn

- **GIVEN** the memory database is temporarily unavailable
- **WHEN** the session starts automatic recall for a turn
- **THEN** the user-facing turn continues without durable recall injection
- **AND** the session records degraded memory status for diagnostics

### Requirement: Main session owns durable memory persistence

The main user-facing session SHALL be the default owner of durable memory
writes. Subagents and other helper workflows SHALL return findings to the
owning session, and the owning session SHALL decide whether those findings
become checkpoints and durable writes.

#### Scenario: Subagent findings flow through the parent session

- **GIVEN** a subagent returns structured findings from research work
- **WHEN** the parent session accepts those findings
- **THEN** the parent session turns them into a checkpoint for durable memory
  review
- **AND** the subagent does not write durable memory directly

### Requirement: Adopted thread context is not direct durable-memory authority

Adopted thread context SHALL be treated as ephemeral quoted context for model
reasoning, not as ordinary authoritative turn history for direct durable memory
writes, unless the current authorized message explicitly asks Netclaw to store,
correct, or otherwise elevate that information.

For memory policy inputs, `HasAdoptedContext` SHALL mean the adopted window is
non-empty, while `HasThirdPartyAdoptedContext` SHALL mean the adopted window
contains at least one sender id other than the current authorized author.
Automatic memory suppression or equivalent extra caution that exists because the
adopted window may contain somebody else's words SHALL key off
`HasThirdPartyAdoptedContext`, not `HasAdoptedContext` alone.

Truthful approval, audit, and provenance data for the turn SHALL continue to
reflect the full adopted window whenever it is non-empty, including self-only
adopted history.

#### Scenario: Unauthorized adopted fact does not directly write memory

- **GIVEN** adopted context contains an unauthorized speaker claiming a new host
  password
- **WHEN** the authorized user does not explicitly ask Netclaw to store it
- **THEN** the adopted claim does not directly produce a durable memory write

#### Scenario: Authorized message may explicitly elevate adopted fact

- **GIVEN** adopted context contains a prior thread fact
- **AND** the current authorized message says to save that fact to memory
- **WHEN** memory policy otherwise permits the write
- **THEN** the durable memory path may proceed under the current authorized
  message's authority rather than the adopted speaker's authority

#### Scenario: Self-only adopted history does not trigger third-party suppression

- **GIVEN** the adopted window is non-empty
- **AND** every adopted sender id matches the current authorized author
- **WHEN** automatic memory policy evaluates the turn
- **THEN** `HasAdoptedContext` is true
- **AND** `HasThirdPartyAdoptedContext` is false
- **AND** memory suppression is not triggered solely by adopted-context presence

#### Scenario: Third-party adopted history triggers suppression input

- **GIVEN** the adopted window contains a sender id different from the current
  authorized author
- **WHEN** automatic memory policy evaluates the turn
- **THEN** `HasThirdPartyAdoptedContext` is true
- **AND** any third-party-adopted suppression rule keys off that state

### Requirement: Explicit memory control paths

The system SHALL treat `store_memory` and `update_memory` as deliberate
manual-control paths layered on top of automatic recall and background curation.
The frontline agent SHALL invoke `store_memory` only for explicit
remember/save requests, deliberate high-value pinning, or operator-directed
structured note capture. The frontline agent SHALL invoke `update_memory` only
for correction, supersede, tombstone, or metadata changes to an existing
durable memory item.

#### Scenario: Frontline agent uses store_memory for an explicit save request

- **GIVEN** the user explicitly asks Netclaw to remember a fact or preference
- **WHEN** the frontline agent chooses how to persist that information
- **THEN** it uses `store_memory` as the deliberate explicit write path
- **AND** the request still flows through checkpoint and policy handling rather
  than direct uncontrolled persistence

#### Scenario: Frontline agent uses update_memory for correction

- **GIVEN** an existing durable memory item must be corrected or superseded
- **WHEN** the frontline agent applies the user's correction
- **THEN** it uses `update_memory`
- **AND** it does not use `store_memory` to create an untracked duplicate for
  the same correction

### Requirement: Memory evaluation and operational criteria

The redesigned memory subsystem SHALL ship with an eval suite and operational
SLOs covering recall quality, noise suppression, privacy behavior, and latency.
The implementation SHALL NOT be considered complete until the seeded eval suite
demonstrates the configured thresholds.

#### Scenario: Seeded memory eval suite passes

- **GIVEN** the seeded recall/privacy fixture suite is executed against the
  redesigned subsystem
- **WHEN** the results are reported
- **THEN** relevant recall coverage, noise suppression, privacy leakage, and
  latency metrics meet the thresholds defined by the change design
- **AND** a failing metric blocks rollout from being treated as complete

#### Scenario: Local Ollama eval profile is the primary gate

- **GIVEN** the seeded memory eval suite supports multiple model profiles
- **WHEN** Netclaw validates the redesigned memory subsystem before rollout
- **THEN** it runs the default gate against smaller local Ollama-hosted models
- **AND** passing larger hosted models does not waive a failing local Ollama
  eval result

### Requirement: Greenfield SQLite-first delivery stance

The redesigned memory subsystem SHALL be implementation-ready as a greenfield
MVP without requiring legacy markdown import or legacy provider-mode
compatibility. Explicit memory tool names SHALL remain stable within the
redesigned subsystem so prompt and skill guidance can target a consistent
manual-control surface.

#### Scenario: Greenfield MVP completes without import work

- **GIVEN** Netclaw has no production-deployed public memory data that must be
  preserved
- **WHEN** the redesigned memory subsystem is implemented for MVP
- **THEN** no markdown import or provider-mode migration is required for
  completeness
- **AND** deferred legacy compatibility does not block delivery

#### Scenario: Explicit tool names remain stable

- **GIVEN** a prompt or skill instructs the model to use `find_memories` and
  `store_memory`
- **WHEN** the redesigned memory subsystem is active
- **THEN** those tool names continue to function
- **AND** they execute against the SQLite memory service and policy pipeline

### Requirement: Approval-resumed memory decisions use turn context

Memory recall, memory curation, and memory checkpoint payloads created during an approval-resumed session turn SHALL use the active or restored turn context for audience, boundary, and adopted-context policy inputs. They SHALL NOT derive those inputs from missing live transport metadata after recovery.

#### Scenario: Recovered third-party adopted context suppresses automatic curation

- **GIVEN** an approval-paused turn was originally created with third-party adopted context
- **AND** the session cold-recovers before the approval response arrives
- **WHEN** the approved tool redrive completes and memory curation evaluates proposals for the resumed turn
- **THEN** curation reads `HasThirdPartyAdoptedContext` from the restored turn context
- **AND** automatic memory formation is suppressed unless the authorized user explicitly elevated the adopted fact

#### Scenario: Self-only adopted context does not suppress solely by presence

- **GIVEN** an approval-paused turn was originally created with self-only adopted context
- **WHEN** the recovered turn resumes and memory policy evaluates the turn
- **THEN** memory policy sees adopted context as present
- **AND** `HasThirdPartyAdoptedContext` remains false
- **AND** automatic memory suppression is not triggered solely by adopted-context presence

#### Scenario: Recovered memory boundary matches original turn

- **GIVEN** an approval-paused Team turn was recovered after restart
- **WHEN** memory recall or checkpoint payloads are created during the resumed continuation
- **THEN** their audience and boundary come from the restored turn context
- **AND** they do not fall back to Public because live `MessageSource` is absent
