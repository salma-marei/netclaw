# netclaw-model-capabilities Specification

## Purpose

Define model capability detection, caching, and modality representation for
multimodal LLM support.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Model modality type system

The system SHALL represent model capabilities using a `ModelModality` flags
enum with values `Text`, `Image`, `Audio`, and `Video`. Model capabilities
SHALL be expressed as a pair of `InputModalities` and `OutputModalities`
values, each being a combination of `ModelModality` flags.

#### Scenario: Modality flags compose

- **GIVEN** a model that accepts text and images and produces text
- **WHEN** its capabilities are represented
- **THEN** `InputModalities` SHALL equal `Text | Image`
- **AND** `OutputModalities` SHALL equal `Text`

#### Scenario: Default modality is text-only

- **GIVEN** a model whose capabilities cannot be determined
- **WHEN** the system assigns default capabilities
- **THEN** `InputModalities` SHALL equal `Text`
- **AND** `OutputModalities` SHALL equal `Text`

### Requirement: Singleton capability cache actor

The system SHALL maintain a singleton `ModelCapabilityActor` registered in the
`ActorRegistry`. The actor SHALL maintain an in-memory cache of model
capabilities keyed by model ID. Other actors SHALL query capabilities via
`Ask<ModelCapabilities>` using a `GetModelCapabilities` message containing the
model ID.

#### Scenario: First query triggers lookup

- **GIVEN** the capability cache has no entry for model `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`
- **WHEN** an actor sends `GetModelCapabilities("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4")`
- **THEN** the actor SHALL resolve capabilities from the detection hierarchy
- **AND** cache the result
- **AND** respond with `ModelCapabilities` containing the resolved modalities

#### Scenario: Cached query returns immediately

- **GIVEN** the capability cache has an entry for model `qwen3:30b`
- **WHEN** an actor sends `GetModelCapabilities("qwen3:30b")`
- **THEN** the actor SHALL respond from cache without external API calls

#### Scenario: Concurrent queries for same model are deduplicated

- **GIVEN** a lookup for model `llava:latest` is in progress
- **WHEN** additional `GetModelCapabilities("llava:latest")` queries arrive
- **THEN** the actor SHALL stash duplicate queries
- **AND** respond to all stashed queries with the same result when the lookup completes

### Requirement: Provider-native capability detection

The system SHALL extract modality data from provider APIs that natively expose
it, as the highest-priority detection source.

#### Scenario: Ollama capability detection

- **GIVEN** a model is configured on an Ollama provider
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for that model
- **THEN** the system SHALL call `POST /api/show` on the Ollama endpoint
- **AND** map the `capabilities` array to `ModelModality` flags
- **AND** `"vision"` in capabilities SHALL map to `InputModalities` including `Image`

#### Scenario: OpenRouter capability detection

- **GIVEN** a model is configured on an OpenRouter provider
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for that model
- **THEN** the system SHALL use `architecture.input_modalities` and
  `architecture.output_modalities` from the OpenRouter model listing
- **AND** map array values (`"text"`, `"image"`, `"audio"`, `"video"`) to
  corresponding `ModelModality` flags

#### Scenario: OpenAI-compatible backend strategy detection

- **GIVEN** a model is configured on an `openai-compatible` provider
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for that model
- **THEN** the system SHALL probe `/v1/models` and the optional llama.cpp
  `/props` endpoint
- **AND** dispatch the probe to the first matching backend strategy in priority
  order: DwarfStar/ds4, vLLM, llama.cpp, generic OpenAI-compatible

#### Scenario: DwarfStar ds4 context detection

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` entry for the configured model
  has `owned_by: "ds4.c"`
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for that model
- **THEN** the DwarfStar/ds4 strategy SHALL match before broader backend
  heuristics
- **AND** context window SHALL be read from top-level `context_length`, falling
  back to `top_provider.context_length`
- **AND** input and output modalities SHALL resolve to `Text`

### Requirement: OpenRouter oracle for cross-provider lookup

The system SHALL use OpenRouter's public `GET /api/v1/models` endpoint as a
capability oracle for models accessed through providers that do not expose
capability metadata (Anthropic, OpenAI). This lookup SHALL NOT require an API
key.

#### Scenario: Anthropic model resolved via OpenRouter oracle

- **GIVEN** a model `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` is configured on the Anthropic provider
- **AND** the Anthropic API does not expose modality metadata
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for that model
- **THEN** the system SHALL query OpenRouter's model listing
- **AND** normalize the model ID for matching (e.g., strip date suffix, add
  provider prefix)
- **AND** return capabilities from the matched OpenRouter entry

#### Scenario: OpenRouter oracle unreachable

- **GIVEN** the OpenRouter API is unreachable or times out within 5 seconds
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for a model requiring oracle lookup
- **THEN** the system SHALL fall through to the next detection tier
- **AND** log a warning indicating oracle lookup failed

### Requirement: OpenAI-compatible backend strategy selection

The system SHALL identify the concrete backend serving an OpenAI-compatible
endpoint (llama.cpp, vLLM, or unknown/generic) from a single probe of
`/v1/models` and `/props`, and dispatch capability parsing to the matching
backend strategy. Strategies SHALL be evaluated in priority order: DwarfStar/ds4,
vLLM, llama.cpp, generic. The first strategy whose match predicate succeeds
SHALL produce the resolver's result.

#### Scenario: vLLM backend detected via max_model_len

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI-compatible endpoint where `GET /v1/models` returns a
  model entry containing a top-level `max_model_len` field
- **AND** `GET /props` returns HTTP 404
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved
- **THEN** the vLLM strategy SHALL match the probe
- **AND** `ContextWindowTokens` SHALL equal the `max_model_len` value
- **AND** `InputModalities` and `OutputModalities` SHALL be left null for
  later resolvers to fill

#### Scenario: vLLM backend detected via owned_by

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI-compatible endpoint where `GET /v1/models` returns a
  model entry with `owned_by: "vllm"`
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved
- **THEN** the vLLM strategy SHALL match the probe regardless of which
  numeric fields are present

#### Scenario: llama.cpp backend detected via /props

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI-compatible endpoint where `GET /props` returns
  HTTP 200 with a `default_generation_settings.params.n_ctx` value
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved
- **THEN** the llama.cpp strategy SHALL match the probe
- **AND** `ContextWindowTokens` SHALL prefer the `/props` value over
  `meta.n_ctx_train` from `/v1/models`
- **AND** `InputModalities` SHALL include `Image` when
  `/props.modalities.vision` is `true`

#### Scenario: Generic OpenAI-compatible fallback

- **GIVEN** an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that exposes neither vLLM nor
  llama.cpp signals
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved
- **THEN** the generic strategy SHALL match
- **AND** the resolver SHALL return `(modelId, null, null, null)` so the
  downstream chain (HuggingFace, OpenRouter oracle) fills in fields

### Requirement: Provider-aware resolver scoping

Every `IModelCapabilityResolver` SHALL expose a nullable
`ProviderType` property identifying which provider type the resolver
speaks for. Provider-native resolvers SHALL return a non-null value
(e.g., `"openai"`, `"ollama"`, `"openai-compatible"`). Cross-provider
oracle resolvers (`OpenRouterOracleResolver`,
`HuggingFaceCapabilityResolver`) SHALL return `null`, indicating they
apply to all providers.

The composite capability resolver SHALL invoke a resolver only when its
`ProviderType` is `null` OR when its `ProviderType` matches the active
model's `ModelReference.Provider`. Filtering SHALL happen before the
merge walk so foreign provider-native resolvers never issue HTTP probes
for models they cannot resolve.

#### Scenario: Foreign provider-native resolver skipped

- **GIVEN** a model with `ModelReference.Provider = "openai-compatible"`
- **AND** an `OllamaCapabilityResolver` (`ProviderType = "ollama"`)
  registered in the chain
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved
- **THEN** the Ollama resolver SHALL NOT be invoked
- **AND** no `POST /api/show` request SHALL be issued to the Ollama
  endpoint

#### Scenario: Matching provider-native resolver runs

- **GIVEN** a model with `ModelReference.Provider = "openai-compatible"`
- **AND** an `OpenAiCompatibleCapabilityResolver`
  (`ProviderType = "openai-compatible"`) registered in the chain
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved
- **THEN** the OpenAI-compatible resolver SHALL be invoked

#### Scenario: Oracle resolvers always eligible

- **GIVEN** a model on any provider
- **AND** `HuggingFaceCapabilityResolver` (`ProviderType = null`)
  registered in the chain
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved
- **THEN** the HuggingFace resolver SHALL be eligible regardless of the
  model's provider

#### Scenario: Parallel native backends do not cross-probe

- **GIVEN** both an `OllamaCapabilityResolver` and an
  `OpenAiCompatibleCapabilityResolver` are registered
- **AND** the active query targets a model on the OpenAI-compatible
  provider
- **WHEN** the composite walks the chain
- **THEN** only the OpenAI-compatible resolver issues HTTP probes
- **AND** the Ollama endpoint receives zero traffic for the query

### Requirement: Composite resolver field-merge semantics

The composite capability resolver SHALL combine results across registered
resolvers by taking the first non-null value per field rather than
short-circuiting on the first non-null result. A resolver SHALL be
permitted to populate any subset of `(InputModalities, OutputModalities,
ContextWindowTokens)`, returning null for fields it cannot determine.

Per-resolver timeout (5 seconds) and exception-to-warning behavior from
the existing resolver chain SHALL be preserved.

#### Scenario: vLLM context + HuggingFace modality merge

- **GIVEN** the OpenAI-compatible resolver returns `(modelId, null, null, 256000)`
- **AND** the HuggingFace resolver returns `(modelId, Text|Image, Text, null)`
- **WHEN** the composite resolver merges these results
- **THEN** the merged record SHALL be `(modelId, Text|Image, Text, 256000)`

#### Scenario: First non-null wins per field

- **GIVEN** resolver A returns `ContextWindowTokens = 200000`
- **AND** resolver B (later in the chain) returns `ContextWindowTokens = 256000`
- **WHEN** the composite resolver merges these results
- **THEN** the merged record SHALL preserve the value from resolver A

#### Scenario: All resolvers return null fields

- **GIVEN** every registered resolver returns null for `InputModalities`,
  `OutputModalities`, and `ContextWindowTokens`
- **WHEN** the composite returns its merged result
- **THEN** the merged record SHALL carry null values
- **AND** downstream consumption SHALL apply text-only / default-context
  defaults at the boundary (existing
  `ModelCapabilityResolution.ResolveModelCapabilities` behavior)

### Requirement: Per-request timings extraction across backends

The OpenAI-compatible chat client SHALL extract per-request token usage
and timing telemetry from the response using a chain of
`ITimingsExtractor` implementations. Extractors SHALL run in sequence on
every response. Field paths are non-overlapping across supported
backends so multiple extractors can safely run without conflict.

`UsageDetails.CachedInputTokens` SHALL be populated from whichever
backend-specific field is present:
- llama.cpp: `timings.cache_n`
- vLLM (and any OpenAI-standard prefix-cache backend):
  `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`

`UsageDetails.PromptMs` SHALL prefer a server-supplied value when
present (llama.cpp `timings.prompt_ms`). When no server value is
available, the chat client SHALL populate `PromptMs` from a client-side
wall-clock measurement between HTTP request send and the first response
byte received.

#### Scenario: vLLM cached_tokens flow through

- **GIVEN** a vLLM `/v1/chat/completions` response with
  `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens = 1024`
- **WHEN** the chat client parses usage
- **THEN** `UsageDetails.CachedInputTokens` SHALL equal `1024`

#### Scenario: llama.cpp timings still extracted

- **GIVEN** a llama.cpp `/v1/chat/completions` response with a top-level
  `timings` object containing `cache_n = 2048` and `prompt_ms = 450.0`
- **WHEN** the chat client parses usage
- **THEN** `UsageDetails.CachedInputTokens` SHALL equal `2048`
- **AND** `UsageDetails.PromptMs` SHALL equal `450.0`

#### Scenario: Fallback wall-clock prompt_ms

- **GIVEN** a backend response that contains no `timings.prompt_ms` and no
  other server-provided prompt latency
- **WHEN** the chat client receives the first response byte 120ms after
  sending the request
- **THEN** `UsageDetails.PromptMs` SHALL equal approximately `120.0`
  (within wall-clock measurement tolerance)

### Requirement: HuggingFace fallback detection

The system SHALL query the HuggingFace Hub API at
`GET https://huggingface.co/api/models/{id}` to fill capability fields
that earlier resolvers in the chain left unpopulated, in addition to the
existing role as a fallback when provider-native and OpenRouter oracle
lookups produce no result. HuggingFace lookup SHALL be skipped for model
IDs that do not match the `<org>/<model>` form (existing
`ModelIdNormalizer.GetCandidates` filter).

#### Scenario: Open-source model resolved via HuggingFace

- **GIVEN** a model is not found in the OpenRouter catalog
- **AND** the model has a HuggingFace model ID
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for that model
- **THEN** the system SHALL query the HuggingFace API
- **AND** map the `pipeline_tag` field to `ModelModality` flags
- **AND** `"image-text-to-text"` SHALL map to `InputModalities: Text | Image`

#### Scenario: HuggingFace fills modality left null by OpenAI-compatible resolver

- **GIVEN** the OpenAI-compatible resolver returned a non-null
  `ContextWindowTokens` but null `InputModalities` (vLLM backend)
- **AND** the served model id has the `<org>/<model>` form
- **WHEN** the composite continues through the resolver chain
- **THEN** the HuggingFace resolver SHALL be consulted
- **AND** its returned `InputModalities` / `OutputModalities` SHALL merge
  into the final result

#### Scenario: HuggingFace lookup fails

- **GIVEN** the HuggingFace API returns a 404 or is unreachable
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for that model
- **THEN** the system SHALL use the default text-only capabilities
- **AND** log a warning

### Requirement: Model ID normalization

The system SHALL normalize model IDs when performing cross-provider lookups to
account for provider-specific naming conventions.

#### Scenario: Date suffix stripped for matching

- **GIVEN** a model ID `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- **WHEN** performing an OpenRouter oracle lookup
- **THEN** the system SHALL attempt matching against `claude-sonnet-4`
  and `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4`

#### Scenario: Ollama tag stripped for matching

- **GIVEN** a model ID `llava:latest`
- **WHEN** performing a cross-provider lookup
- **THEN** the system SHALL attempt matching against `llava`

### Requirement: Manual capability override

The system SHALL allow operators to explicitly declare model capabilities in
the `ModelReference` configuration. Manual overrides SHALL take precedence
over all automated detection sources.

#### Scenario: Manual override bypasses detection

- **GIVEN** a `ModelReference` with explicitly configured `InputModalities`
  and `OutputModalities`
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved for that model
- **THEN** the system SHALL use the configured values without querying any
  external API

### Requirement: Capability lookup failure resilience

The system SHALL NOT block session startup or message processing if
capability detection fails. Resolvers in the chain MAY return null values
for any field they cannot determine; the composite SHALL propagate those
nulls. The final consumption boundary
(`ModelCapabilityResolution.ResolveModelCapabilities`) SHALL apply
text-only modality and default-context defaults when no resolver supplies
a value, and SHALL log a warning identifying the unresolved fields.

#### Scenario: All detection tiers return null modality

- **WHEN** provider-native, OpenRouter oracle, OpenAI-compatible, and
  HuggingFace resolvers all return null for `InputModalities`
- **THEN** the consumption boundary SHALL apply
  `InputModalities: Text, OutputModalities: Text` for that model ID
- **AND** log a warning with the model ID and the unresolved fields
- **AND** the session SHALL proceed normally with text-only behavior

#### Scenario: Manual override still wins

- **GIVEN** a `ModelReference` with explicitly configured
  `InputModalities`
- **WHEN** capabilities are resolved
- **THEN** the configured value SHALL be used regardless of what any
  resolver returned (existing `ModelCapabilityResolution` precedence)

### Requirement: Model capability resolution produces standalone ModelCapabilities

The model capability detection pipeline SHALL produce a `ModelCapabilities` record
as its output type. This record SHALL be registered as a standalone DI singleton,
independent of `SessionConfig`. The `SessionConfig` type SHALL NOT contain
`ModelId`, `ContextWindowTokens`, `InputModalities`, or `OutputModalities` —
these are exclusively owned by `ModelCapabilities`.

Consumers that previously read model properties from `SessionConfig` SHALL
instead take `ModelCapabilities` as a dependency.

#### Scenario: ModelCapabilities resolved and registered separately

- **GIVEN** the daemon startup resolves model capabilities via the detection
  hierarchy
- **WHEN** the resolved capabilities are registered in DI
- **THEN** `ModelCapabilities` is available as a separate singleton
- **AND** `SessionConfig` does not carry model-derived fields

#### Scenario: LlmSessionActor receives ModelCapabilities via DI

- **GIVEN** `ModelCapabilities` is registered in the DI container
- **WHEN** `resolver.Props<LlmSessionActor>(entityId)` resolves constructor params
- **THEN** the actor receives `ModelCapabilities` as a separate parameter
- **AND** uses `ModelCapabilities.ContextWindowTokens` for compaction decisions
- **AND** uses `ModelCapabilities.InputModalities` for modality gating

#### Scenario: DaemonRuntimeStatusService uses ModelCapabilities

- **GIVEN** `DaemonRuntimeStatusService` needs model display information
- **WHEN** the service is constructed
- **THEN** it takes `ModelCapabilities` as a dependency (not `SessionConfig`)
- **AND** reads `ModelId`, `InputModalities`, and `OutputModalities` from it

### Requirement: Complete session input compatibility check

The session actor SHALL check all active persisted media and all new media against the active model input modalities before each model call.
The check SHALL include recovered history and media that a tool adds during the current turn.
The actor SHALL reject an unsupported or unknown modality before any primary, fallback, or provider client receives a request.
The actor SHALL preserve all original media references and SHALL identify the incompatible modalities in the session error.

#### Scenario: Recovered image history meets a text-only model

- **GIVEN** a recovered session contains an image media reference
- **AND** the active model accepts text only
- **WHEN** the user resumes the session
- **THEN** the actor SHALL emit an input compatibility error
- **AND** the error SHALL identify image input as unsupported
- **AND** no primary, fallback, or provider client SHALL receive a request

#### Scenario: New unsupported media is rejected before turn admission

- **GIVEN** a new user command contains an image media reference
- **AND** the active model accepts text only
- **WHEN** the actor receives the command
- **THEN** the actor SHALL reject the command before it adds the user message to session state
- **AND** no model client SHALL receive a request

#### Scenario: Tool-produced media is checked before the next call

- **GIVEN** the active model call starts with compatible text input
- **AND** a tool result adds media that the active model cannot accept
- **WHEN** the actor prepares the next model call
- **THEN** the actor SHALL fail the current turn with an input compatibility error
- **AND** no later model client SHALL receive the incompatible request

#### Scenario: Unknown persisted modality fails closed

- **GIVEN** a session contains a media reference with an unknown modality value
- **WHEN** the actor prepares a model call
- **THEN** the actor SHALL emit an input compatibility error
- **AND** no model client SHALL receive a request

#### Scenario: Compatible media reaches the model

- **GIVEN** all session media modalities are accepted by the active model
- **WHEN** the actor prepares a model call
- **THEN** the actor SHALL preserve the media references
- **AND** the model call SHALL proceed through normal routing
