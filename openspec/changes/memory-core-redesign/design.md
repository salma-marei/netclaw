# Design: memory-core-redesign

## Context

The July 2026 audit (`docs/research/memory-audit-2026-07.md`) measured the
memory system end-to-end against the live 1,216-document corpus: 46% of
auto-injected memories are pollution (relevance judged, κ=0.754); the lexical
composite score carries no relevance signal (precision flat across every
floor); the LLM curation tier had **zero** successful decisions in its
production lifetime; consolidation fired twice ever while redundancy reached
14% and doubled in five weeks; the checkpoint worker drops 95% of its intake;
`Searchable` recall mode secretly participates in automatic recall; the Trace
class and expiry mechanics are fully vestigial (0 traces ever, no deletion,
204 expired records mummified on disk); `memory_edges` has 0 rows and the
facet planner knows 4 demo facets against ~900 real ones.

The quick-win slice (PR #1568) revived the LLM tier, adopted the balanced
curation prompt, re-tuned lexical scoring, and added an injection budget.
This change is the structural remainder: add the missing **judgment**
(embeddings), add the missing **metabolism** (lifecycle: lossless merge,
expiry, consolidation), and **subtract** the dead structure that three
redesign cycles accreted. Prior art constraints come from the May 2026
autoresearch (`docs/research/memory-recall-findings-2026-05.md`): nominate-by-cosine/decide-by-LLM is
ratified (no cosine threshold separates duplicates from siblings — siblings
live at 0.905–0.941 inside the duplicate band), and the nominator model is
snowflake-arctic-embed 137M (33M-class models measured inadequate for
doc-to-doc dedup).

Actor/persistence context: memory lives in the daemon's single SQLite file
(`NetclawPaths.MemorySqliteDbPath == SqliteDbPath`), whose memory tables are
owned by `SQLiteMemoryStore.InitializeAsync` (idempotent DDL), NOT by the
daemon's `SchemaMigrator`. Two write pipelines exist today: the inline
per-session path (`SessionMemoryObserverActor` → `MemoryProposalGate` →
`MemoryCurationActor`, a per-session child of `LlmSessionActor`) and the
daemon checkpoint worker (`MemoryCurationWorkerService` →
`MemoryCurationEngine`). Recall runs on the session actor's turn path under a
hard latency budget (`Memory.RecallTimeoutMs`, default 300 ms).

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals**

1. Fewer, more comprehensive memories: near-duplicates are detected
   semantically at write time and merged losslessly.
2. Fewer, more accurate injections: recall is gated by an absolute semantic
   relevance floor; most turns inject nothing (measured correct outcome for
   65% of real queries).
3. A real lifecycle: expired rows are deleted, redundant clusters are
   consolidated under operator control, short-lived (≈72 h) memories exist
   and work.
4. Tool-use lessons are captured and surface exactly when the relevant tool
   is used.
5. Less machinery: taxonomy and pipelines shrink to the behaviors that
   actually exist; every metadata field written is consumed by a reader.

**Non-Goals**

- Multilingual embeddings (model swap later; vectors keyed by `model_id`).
- ANN indexes (brute force is sub-ms at this corpus scale; revisit ≥50k).
- Automatic (code-level) detection of tool-use corrections.
- Applying consolidation to any corpus as part of implementation (tooling
  ships; each apply run is an operator decision).
- Multi-node/cluster memory; this remains single-process MVP.

## Decisions

### D1. Embedding runtime: in-process ONNX, new `src/Netclaw.Embeddings` project

`Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` (CPU EP; linux-x64 + linux-arm64 ship in 1.25+) +
`FastBertTokenizer` (pure managed WordPiece — the chosen model is BERT-class)
+ `System.Numerics.Tensors` for SIMD cosine. The consumer-defined seam
`IMemoryEmbedder` lives in `Netclaw.Actors/Memory` so actor code never
references OnnxRuntime; `Netclaw.Embeddings` is referenced by Daemon and CLI
only. A singleton `OnnxMemoryEmbedder` holds one `InferenceSession`
(`IntraOpNumThreads` bounded, concurrency semaphore ≤2); an
`UnavailableMemoryEmbedder` stub carries `IsAvailable=false` for degraded
mode.

*Alternative considered*: Ollama sidecar — rejected: violates the
single-process constitution, adds a network hop inside the recall budget, and
creates a second silent-failure surface. *Alternative*: embedding via the
existing chat-provider plugins — rejected: recall must work when no provider
is reachable, and provider embedding APIs are not uniformly available.

### D2. Model provisioning: pinned allowlist, download at initialization, never embedded

`Memory.Embeddings.ModelId` selects from an **in-code allowlist manifest**
(model id → URL + byte size + SHA-256); arbitrary URLs are rejected
(supply-chain boundary). An `EmbeddingWarmupHostedService` provisions at
daemon start when `AutoDownload=true` (atomic temp+rename download, hash
verify, then one warm-up inference), or the operator runs
`netclaw memory backfill-embeddings`. The ~90–140 MB artifact is never an
embedded resource (would bloat every RID publish). Default model:
snowflake-arctic-embed-m (~110M params, fp32 ONNX, pinned by hash — int8 is a
future optimization, not what Stage A shipped; May-ratified), mxbai-embed-large
335M is the allowlisted fallback. Post-PoC decision deferred: mirroring
artifacts into the existing R2 feeds channel vs pinned upstream URLs.

### D3. Vector storage: separate `memory_embeddings` table, owned by the store

`memory_embeddings(item_id, item_kind, model_id, content_hash, dims, vector
BLOB, created_at, PRIMARY KEY(item_id, model_id))`, created in
`SQLiteMemoryStore.InitializeAsync` alongside the other memory DDL — not a
daemon migration, preserving the store's standalone-initialization contract
(doctor and tests construct it without the migrator). Content hash =
SHA-256 of normalized title+body; re-embed is skip-if-hash-match, so backfill
re-runs are free. Model change = new `model_id` rows + `--force` backfill; no
rewrite of the 224 MB documents table. Backfill state is **derived**
(LEFT JOIN on current model + hash), never a progress table. kNN executes as
a brute-force scan over an in-memory `MemoryVectorIndex` (flat float[] per
model, ~1.8 MB at current scale, invalidated by a store version counter). No
sqlite-vec/native extensions (ARM64 + deployment liability for zero benefit
at this scale).

*Failure/recovery*: a crash between document commit and embedding upsert
leaves a missing-embedding row; the warmup service's gap-repair sweep and the
embedding doctor check both surface and heal it. Vectors are derived data —
loss is always recoverable by re-embedding.

### D4. Write-side: one evaluator; kNN nominates, LLM decides; no cosine auto-merge

The duplicated evaluation logic in `MemoryCurationActor.EvaluateSingleAsync`
and `MemoryCurationEngine` collapses into one shared `MemoryCurationEvaluator`
used by both the inline actor and the daemon worker (today's guards diverge —
`GuardDestructiveUpdate` exists on one path only). Evaluation order:

1. Exact-anchor + near-identical body → deterministic SKIP (cheap fast path).
2. Embedding kNN nomination at `NominatorSimilarityThreshold` (default 0.86)
   / `NominatorK` (default 5). **Any nominee forces the LLM tier** — the May
   measurement stands: no cosine threshold separates duplicates from siblings,
   so cosine never auto-merges and never auto-skips.
3. No nominee and no anchor match → CREATE without an LLM call (the common
   case stays cheap; median nominee count on a random write is 0).
4. Embedder unavailable → the current lexical candidate search runs as the
   explicitly-logged degraded path.

*Alternative considered*: cosine auto-merge tier above 0.95 — rejected: the
measured sample shows ~3 pairs there, not worth a data-loss risk surface.

### D5. Lossless merge: LLM-synthesized body + deterministic MergeGuard + append fallback

CONSOLIDATE/UPDATE decisions now carry a merged body
(`CurationDecision.MergedBody`) synthesized by the curation LLM from
full-content previews. A deterministic `MergeGuard` validates it: load-bearing
tokens (URLs, numbers, versions, dates, code identifiers) from every source
body must survive (≥95%), and length must not collapse. On failure the write
degrades to a **structural append** (existing body + dated separator +
proposal — finally producing the `AppendDocument` semantics that have existed
unused since the enums were written). The raw
`markdown_body = excluded.markdown_body` overwrite becomes unreachable from
curation decisions. Records remain immutable and curation-bypassing.

*Why not prompt-only*: the May decider eval measured the balanced prompt at
~27% wrong-merge on hard near-duplicates. The guard turns a wrong merge from
silent data loss into recoverable over-consolidation.

### D6. Read-side: hybrid recall with an absolute cosine floor

Per turn: embed the query once (sub-budget inside `RecallTimeoutMs`; on
timeout or unavailable → lexical-only + rate-limited
`memory_recall_vector_degraded` log). Candidates = FTS5 top-k ∪ vector top-k,
deduplicated, **all candidates passing the identical policy gates**
(audience/boundary/sensitivity/recall-mode) regardless of source — a
correctness requirement with its own scenario. Scoring = weighted fusion
(`VectorWeight` 0.7 × cosine + `LexicalWeight` 0.3 × squashed selector score
+ dampened class prior), then an **absolute floor**: `MinCosineSimilarity`
(default **0.68**, calibrated 2026-07-05 against the real-traffic gold set
`gold-prod-2026-07` — calibration summary below). Nothing above the floor →
inject nothing, and the volatile `[memory-recall]` block is omitted entirely
(zero tokens). The floor applies only to a candidate the vector index
actually holds an embedding for; a candidate with no embedding row at all
(a coverage gap — not yet backfilled, or written before embeddings were
enabled) has no cosine for the floor to gate, so it degrades to lexical
scoring instead (its cosine term is 0, ranked purely on the fused
lexical/class-prior score) with a rate-limited `memory_recall_coverage_gap`
warning — honoring the Migration Plan's "both paths degrade loudly to
lexical when coverage is incomplete rather than misbehaving" rather than
blacking out recall for an un-backfilled corpus while the embedder is
otherwise healthy. Coverage self-heals via embed-on-write (new/updated
documents) plus gap repair (backfilling pre-existing ones), so the warning
is expected to fall off after both complete. Recency decay
(`RecencyHalfLifeDays`, floor-bounded multiplier) breaks ties toward fresh
knowledge. The quick-win char budget and `AutoRecallMaxItems` remain
the outer bounds.

*Alternative considered*: RRF fusion — rejected: rank-only fusion always
admits the top item even when nothing is relevant; the zero-injection
behavior requires an absolute score. *Latency measured, not assumed*: Ollama
measurements ran far above the 10–50 ms/query assumption, and the in-process
ONNX fp32 measurement (Slice 2 task 2.13; full numbers in Open Questions)
shows the same problem persists — p95 ≈ 315 ms on the i9-9900K reference box,
~2× over the 150 ms sub-budget, because the embedder pads every input to a
fixed 512 tokens regardless of actual length.

**Mitigation, measured (`tools/embed-latency-bench` dynamic-length
extension)**: the ONNX graph's sequence axis is symbolic
(`input_ids`/`attention_mask`/`token_type_ids` all declare
`[batch_size, sequence_length]`, no fixed shape), so padding to the actual
tokenized length (rounded up to a multiple of 8) instead of a fixed 512 is a
drop-in change — no re-export needed. On the same reference box: short-query
p50 **19.0 ms**, p95 **20.9 ms** (was p50 281.9 ms / p95 310.5 ms fixed-512 —
~15× faster, ~7× under the 150 ms sub-budget); medium (~178 tok) p50
**84.1 ms** (was 281.7 ms); doc-length (~442 tok) p50 **235.5 ms** (was
280.3 ms — smaller gain because 442 tokens is already close to 512).
Correctness parity across 10 fixed sentences (short queries + longer bank
sentences), fixed-512 vs dynamic-length, cosine similarity: **1.000000 on
every sentence** (min = mean = 1.000000) — the attention mask fully absorbs
the padding difference, so this is a pure performance change with no
retrieval-quality risk. **Decision: Slice 4 adopts dynamic sequence length
(bucket-of-8 rounding) as the query-embedding mitigation**, not int8
quantization and not a relaxed budget — the 150 ms sub-budget holds with
large headroom once padding is length-aware.

**Floor calibration, measured (2026-07-05, `floor_calibration.py`, task
4.6)**: swept `MinCosineSimilarity` from 0.30 to 0.75 (step 0.01) over the
same 1,216-doc production snapshot (2026-07-03) and the 93-query
`gold-prod-2026-07` gold set (33 positive / 60 zero-relevant queries), using
the fp32 ONNX production-faithful embedder replica and the cached doc/query
vectors already validated for the quantization eval. LOAD DECISION = inject
any of the top-3-by-cosine docs that clear the floor; objective = macro F0.5
against `relevantDocIds`.

| model | optimal τ | F0.5 @ optimum | F0.5 @ 0.55 (old default) | zero-injection acc. @ optimum | plateau shape |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| fp32 `snowflake-arctic-embed-m` (**shipped**) | **0.68** | 0.141 | 0.106 | 13.3% (8/60) | moderate, symmetric — robust to ±0.01 drift, ~29% relative F0.5 drop by ±0.03 |
| uint8 `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-int8` (not shipped, D2) | 0.67 | 0.153 | 0.106 | 16.7% (10/60) | asymmetric knife-edge — flat below the optimum, +0.01 above it costs 35% relative F0.5 |

Production ships fp32 (D2), so **0.68** is the shipped default: +33%
relative F0.5 over the 0.55 placeholder, while mean injected count *drops*
(3.00 → 2.53 — fewer, more pertinent items). uint8's optimum sitting 0.01
lower matches the compression shift already measured for
`NominatorSimilarityThreshold` (D2/D4); it remains informational only, since
int8 is not shipped.

**Caveat that must not be dropped**: even at the F0.5 optimum, **83–87% of
genuinely nothing-relevant `gold-prod-2026-07` queries still get something
injected** (zero-injection accuracy tops out at 13.3–16.7%). Pushing the
floor further right buys more zero-accuracy but costs recall steeply on the
35% of queries where something is relevant (a property of this corpus's
embedding geometry, not a bug in the calibration). An absolute cosine floor
alone cannot close the zero-injection gap within the F0.5-preserving range —
that residual is tracked as the separate `memory-relevance-gate` change, not
solved here.

**Superseded by `memory-query-prefix` (2026-07-08):** the 0.68 figure above
was measured with the query embedded RAW — `snowflake-arctic-embed-m`'s
documented retrieval-query prefix (`Represent this sentence for searching
relevant passages: `) was never applied. That is a no-prefix historical
record, kept here for the archive, not the calibration of record. Applying
the prefix compresses the model's cosine distribution downward (optimal τ
0.68 → 0.24) and lifts F0.5 at the optimum from 0.141 to 0.239 (+69%
relative) — see `openspec/changes/memory-query-prefix/design.md` D4 for the
full prefixed sweep and the atomic prefix+floor recalibration rationale.
`MemoryRecallConfig.MinCosineSimilarity` no longer defaults to 0.68; it
defaults to null and follows the active model's manifest-carried
calibration (0.24 for the shipped prefixed encoding).

### D7. Taxonomy rebalance: recall modes mean what they say

- **BREAKING (semantic fix)**: `Searchable` leaves the automatic recall pool
  (`SearchByPlanAsync` admits `auto` only). `Searchable` = find_memories
  surface; `Manual` = explicit-id access; `Never` = policy-hidden. The 22
  legacy compaction rows were already repaired in the quick-win slice; a
  startup data-repair re-asserts invariants idempotently.
- Formation: the observer sidecar proposes a recall mode; the policy gate
  honors it for durable facts with **default `searchable`** — `auto` is
  reserved for standing facts that should color every conversation (identity,
  durable preferences, environment). This breaks the measured 97%-auto
  monoculture at the source. The distillation prompt is rewritten for fewer,
  more comprehensive proposals (consolidate related observations into one
  document; propose fewer atomic fragments).
- **Trace revival**: the sidecar may propose `trace` (short-lived operational
  state, TTL 72 h) — the class becomes reachable, recallable while fresh
  (recall mode `auto` with its TTL as the guard, weighted below durable
  facts), and actually deleted by the expiry sweep (D8).
- **Tool lessons**: new `MemoryClass.ToolLesson` → Document/MergeDocument/
  Searchable, anchored `anchor_type="tool"`, `canonical_name=<tool>`.
  Captured explicitly (`store_memory` accepts the class; the `netclaw-memory`
  skill instructs saving a lesson when the user corrects tool usage) and by
  the sidecar distillation prompt (correction-hunting instruction). Recall is
  **per-tool context injection**: on a tool's first use in a session, the
  tool-execution pipeline appends a compact `[tool-lessons:<name>]` block
  (top 2 by `updated_at`, bounded chars) to the tool result — an exact
  anchor-id lookup, no embedding, outside the pre-turn recall budget, reset
  on compaction. The dead `verified-tool-finding` +25 recall bonus is
  removed; `store_memory` with the class becomes the first real producer of
  the `VerifiedToolFinding` checkpoint flag.

*Alternative considered*: overloading Evidence for lessons — rejected:
Evidence is policy-forced to immutable Record + searchable, so lessons could
never be refined by curation and would never surface unprompted.

### D8. Metabolism: expiry sweep + operator-gated consolidation

- **Expiry sweep**: a daemon maintenance step (piggybacking the checkpoint
  worker's idle loop) DELETEs rows whose `expires_at` has passed beyond a
  grace window — they are already invisible to every read path, so deletion
  is behavior-neutral by construction; each sweep logs counts. (Audit: 204 of
  384 evidence records currently mummified.)
- **Consolidation**: `netclaw memory consolidate --dry-run` builds the kNN
  cluster graph, runs the merge-synthesis prompt per cluster, and writes a
  human-editable `plan.jsonl` + report — no mutation. `--apply --plan <path>`
  executes a reviewed plan verbatim: refuses a live daemon by default, takes
  a `VACUUM INTO` backup first, applies in batched transactions, re-embeds
  merged bodies, rebuilds FTS rows, and records a `memory_maintenance_runs`
  ledger row. `netclaw memory status` reports class/recall-mode/embedding
  coverage. CLI-owned rather than a daemon job because the ratification gate
  is inherently interactive.

### D9. Subtraction

Removed with evidence they carry no load (audit): `memory_edges` table and
its DDL/spec requirement (0 rows ever; anchors remain as flat grouping keys);
the facet/soft-scope *inference* in `DeterministicRetrievalPlanning` (4
hardcoded demo facets; stopword-hygiene and lexical-term extraction remain);
the checkpoint worker's unconditional turn-complete enqueue (gated at enqueue
by the same project-fact precondition the extractor applies — eliminating
~95% wasted enqueue/lease/deserialize cycles; the freed lane is where the
expiry sweep lives). Wire enums keep their values for serialization
compatibility; only dead *behavior* is deleted.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Model download unavailable offline at first run] → loud degraded mode:
  doctor Error, daemon status `embeddings: degraded`, rate-limited logs;
  lexical recall keeps serving. Never silent.
- [Query-embedding latency blows the 300 ms recall budget on CPU] →
  **confirmed with fixed-512 padding, then resolved by measurement** (Slice 2
  task 2.13: p95 ≈ 315 ms, ~2× over the 150 ms sub-budget on the reference
  box). The dynamic-sequence-length experiment (see D6 and Open Questions)
  confirmed the ONNX graph's sequence axis is symbolic (not a fixed shape)
  and measured short-query p95 at 20.9 ms once padding matches actual token
  length — ~7× under budget, with 1.000000 cosine parity against fixed-512
  across 10 test sentences. Slice 4 ships dynamic-length padding
  (bucket-of-8) as the mitigation; warmup inference at start and
  `RecallTimeoutMs` remain in place as defense-in-depth, not as the primary
  fix.
- [LLM merge synthesis loses information] → MergeGuard token-retention check
  + structural-append fallback; consolidation applies only via human-ratified
  plan files with a backup taken first.
- [Cosine floor calibrated on one corpus generalizes poorly] → floor lives in
  config next to `ModelId`; gold-set eval (real traffic) pins the calibration;
  doctor warns on mixed-model embedding rows.
- [Searchable-out-of-auto surprises users who relied on incidental recall] →
  BREAKING is called out; `find_memories` covers the tail; formation default
  changes only affect NEW memories; consolidation plans may propose
  recall-mode changes but only under ratification.
- [ARM64 native OnnxRuntime regression] → CI publish smoke leg on linux-arm64;
  FastBertTokenizer is pure managed.
- [Two write paths drift again during the transition] → shared
  `MemoryCurationEvaluator` lands as its own slice before any nominator work;
  divergence becomes structurally impossible rather than reviewed-for.

## Migration Plan

1. Slices are independently shippable, in order: (1) shared evaluator
   extraction (behavior-neutral refactor), (2) embedding foundation (writes
   vectors, nothing reads them — zero behavior risk), (3) write-side
   nominate→decide + lossless merge, (4) read-side hybrid + cosine floor,
   (5) taxonomy rebalance + trace revival + tool lessons, (6) maintenance
   CLI + expiry sweep + subtraction.
2. Existing corpora: `backfill-embeddings` (measured: minutes) is required
   before slices 3–4 activate their vector paths; both paths degrade loudly
   to lexical when coverage is incomplete rather than misbehaving.
3. Rollback: each slice is config-gated (`Memory.Embeddings.Enabled`,
   nominator/recall thresholds) — disabling returns to the quick-win
   behavior. Vectors are derived data; dropping `memory_embeddings` is safe.
4. Schema: new tables via idempotent `InitializeAsync` DDL; config surface
   added to `netclaw-config.v1.schema.json` with defaults (migration-friendly
   per the constitution's schema rules); `netclaw-memory` system skill updated
   in the same PR as each behavior slice.

## Open Questions

- ~~ONNX int8 query-embedding latency on reference hardware (measure in
  Slice 2; gates Slice 4's sub-budget design)~~ **MEASURED (Slice 2 task
  2.13, `tools/embed-latency-bench`, batch=1, 200 timed iterations/corpus
  after 20 warmups)**. Production path is fp32, not int8 (int8 remains a
  deferred D2 optimization). Reference box: i9-9900K, 8 logical cores,
  contended condition (load avg 2.0–3.6, ~11/15 GiB RAM in use, live daemon
  running):

  | corpus                      | tokens (mean) | p50     | p95    |
  |------------------------------|---------------|---------|--------|
  | short query                  | 13.8          | 281 ms  | 315 ms |
  | medium (~180 tok)             | 178.2         | 274 ms  | 298 ms |
  | doc-length (~440 tok)         | 442.1         | 275 ms  | 294 ms |
  | short, concurrency=2          | 13.8          | 274 ms  | 291 ms |
  | cold load (model load + 1st embed) | —        | 1069 ms | —      |

  All three corpora cost nearly the same regardless of length, because
  `OnnxMemoryEmbedder` always runs a fixed 512-token forward pass (no
  length-based truncation) — the fp32 matmul, not tokenization, dominates.
  Concurrency=2 gave no throughput benefit on this contended box (two
  parallel 100-call loops took as long in aggregate as one sequential
  200-call stream). **Verdict: the 150 ms query-embedding sub-budget does
  not hold on this hardware — p95 is ~2.1× over budget (margin ≈ −165 ms)**;
  the highest-leverage unexplored mitigation is a query-specific max-length
  (e.g. 64 tokens, not int8 quantization) before Slice 4 ships.
- ~~Does dynamic (query-specific) sequence length actually work on this ONNX
  graph, and is it a drop-in change?~~ **MEASURED AND RESOLVED** (same
  `tools/embed-latency-bench`, dynamic-length extension, same box, same
  batch=1/200-iteration/20-warmup protocol). Step 1: `InferenceSession
  .InputMetadata` shows all three inputs (`input_ids`, `attention_mask`,
  `token_type_ids`) declare shape `[batch_size, sequence_length]` — both
  dimensions symbolic, not fixed — so the graph accepts any sequence length;
  no re-export required. Step 2: padding each input to its actual tokenized
  length (rounded up to a multiple of 8) instead of fixed 512:

  | corpus                | tokens (mean) | fixed-512 p50 | fixed-512 p95 | dynamic-len p50 | dynamic-len p95 |
  |------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
  | short query            | 13.8          | 281.9 ms      | 310.5 ms      | **19.0 ms**      | **20.9 ms**      |
  | medium (~178 tok)      | 178.2         | 281.7 ms      | 312.2 ms      | **84.1 ms**      | **93.3 ms**      |
  | doc-length (~442 tok)  | 442.1         | 280.3 ms      | 304.6 ms      | **235.5 ms**     | **250.1 ms**     |

  Step 3, correctness (not just speed): 10 fixed sentences (5 short queries +
  5 longer bank sentences), embedded both ways, cosine similarity fixed-512
  vs dynamic-length — **1.000000 on all 10 (min = mean = 1.000000)**: the
  attention mask fully accounts for the padding difference, so this is a
  correctness-neutral, pure-performance change. Contention context: load
  average 1.40/1.44/2.36 before the ~6-minute run, 4.76/3.63/3.08 after (the
  run's own CPU load, not external contention). **Verdict: dynamic sequence
  length is adopted as the Slice 4 mitigation** — short-query p95 lands at
  ~14% of the 150 ms sub-budget (huge margin), medium and doc-length both
  drop meaningfully too. Int8 quantization and relaxing the sub-budget are no
  longer necessary; both remain available as future levers if traffic shifts
  toward longer queries.
- ~~Final `MinCosineSimilarity` default (calibrate against
  `gold-prod-2026-07` during Slice 4; 0.55 is the working hypothesis)~~
  **MEASURED (Slice 4 task 4.6, `floor_calibration.py`, 2026-07-05)**: fp32
  optimum is **0.68** (F0.5 0.141 vs 0.106 at 0.55; zero-injection accuracy
  13.3%, up from 0%; moderate, symmetric plateau, robust to ±0.01 drift).
  Production ships fp32 (D2), so 0.68 is the shipped default — full
  calibration summary in D6. uint8's optimum (0.67, knife-edge above the
  peak) stays informational until int8 ships. The residual 83–87%
  zero-injection miss rate at the optimum is not solved by the floor alone;
  tracked under the separate `memory-relevance-gate` change.
- Whether the R2 feeds channel should mirror model artifacts (post-PoC
  operational decision; allowlist design is unaffected).
- Trace auto-recall weighting while fresh (small prior vs durable-fact parity)
  — decide with eval cases in Slice 5.
