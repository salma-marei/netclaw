## Context

Use the [Netclaw engineering glossary](../../../docs/spec/GLOSSARY.md) for tool call, dispatcher, tool result, tool receipt, outcome category, authority, transport or session failure, application error, tool-declared error, and OAuth-managed server. This change adds the last four terms to the glossary. See proposal.md for motivation.

The real examples below come from a link-shortener MCP server (`shortio`) observed on 2026-08-26. The server never returned HTTP 5xx. It returned tool-declared errors with the text `Internal Server Error`, HTTP 429 under a 30-requests-per-minute budget, and HTTP 401 for a bad key.

Current flow at `dev` (`94d2bfce`) for an MCP tool call that ends in an exception. This pseudocode is schematic. It omits authorization, redaction, and the output bound.

```text
MCP server or transport throws
  -> McpClientManager.InvokeSharedAsync
       McpException       -> return "Error: MCP tool '<server>/<tool>' failed: <message>"  (no log)
       transport failure  -> log at Debug, reconnect, rethrow
  -> McpToolAdapter.ExecuteAsync
       catch-all          -> return "Error: MCP tool '<name>' failed: <message>"           (no log, no receipt)
  -> DispatchingToolExecutor
       string result      -> receipt category = success
                          -> log "Tool executed: ..." at Information
  -> SessionToolExecutionPipeline
       receipt            -> log "Tool outcome category=Success" at Information
```

Constraints that shape the approach:

- `INetclawTool.ExecuteAsync` returns a string. The public contract stays.
- The tool receipt is first-writer-wins (`ToolExecutionOutputs.TryComplete` uses `CompareExchange`). A tool that completes the receipt before it returns wins over the dispatcher's `success` completion.
- `ToolOutcomeResults` (#2033) already attaches a category to a result string. The workspace tools use it. Its one-argument helpers need no file activity and no remediation code.
- `McpClientManager.IsTransportOrSessionFailure` is the single predicate that decides a reconnect. It has two consumers: the tool path (`InvokeSharedAsync`) and the prompt-skill path (`LoadAsync`).
- `McpClientManager.ReportToolFailure` owns the tool-declared error path and its Warning log.
- The daemon already knows whether it uses OAuth for a server. `HasStoredOAuthTokens` asks the credential store, and `IsOAuthChallenge` recognizes the Bearer-scheme `McpException` the SDK raises after a genuine challenge. `HasOAuthRuntimeHints` reads the `Authorization` header only to decide whether the SDK OAuth handler may be installed without a collision. It must not classify a failure.
- In the SDK (`ModelContextProtocol.Core` 2.2.0), `McpException` carries no error code. Only the derived `McpProtocolException.ErrorCode` does, and the SDK reserves `-32602` for a malformed request or an unknown primitive name. Tool input validation arrives as a tool-declared error, not as this exception.
- The existing test `ToolLevelAuthFailure_MovesServerOutOfConnected` documents the expired-token case: the token failure reaches the agent as a tool-declared error, not as an HTTP 401. Its harness uses a stdio entry today.
- Production always passes the manager as the adapter's invoker (`PrepareMcpTools`). The adapter's bound-tool path is unreachable in the daemon.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- One converter from exception to tool result. The adapter owns it.
- One receipt per failed call with a category the actor can trust.
- One Warning line per failed call in the daemon log.
- Reconnect only for a transport or session failure.
- No false `AuthFailed`, and no `netclaw mcp auth` remedy, for a server that does not use OAuth. Never decide that from header names.
- The fewest moving parts. Reuse existing helpers. Add no new type, interface, or configuration.

**Non-Goals:**

- Change the model-facing text shape of an MCP failure.
- Retry, replay, or add a per-server request budget.
- Propagate `Retry-After` from the SDK exception. The SDK exception carries no headers.
- Map JSON-RPC error codes to categories.
- Change the receipt category of a tool-declared error.
- Change the connect-path auth classification (#1908 covers it).
- Change the adapter's bound-tool path.

## Proposed flow

This pseudocode is schematic. It omits authorization, redaction, and the output bound.

```text
MCP server or transport throws
  -> McpClientManager.InvokeSharedAsync
       caller cancellation            -> rethrow, no log
       any other exception            -> log one Warning (server, tool, HTTP status when present, redacted exception)
         transport or session failure -> reconnect for later calls, rethrow
         application error            -> rethrow, no reconnect
  -> McpToolAdapter.ExecuteAsync
       caller cancellation            -> rethrow
       any other exception            -> receipt category per D1, return "Error: MCP tool '<name>' failed: <message>"
  -> DispatchingToolExecutor
       string result                  -> receipt already complete; "Tool executed: ..." unchanged
  -> SessionToolExecutionPipeline
       receipt                        -> log "Tool outcome category=<category>"
```

## Decisions

### D1. The adapter completes the receipt from the caught exception

`McpToolAdapter.ExecuteAsync` keeps its catch-all. Instead of a bare `return`, it returns the same error string through `ToolOutcomeResults`:

```text
HttpRequestException 401 or 403  -> context.AccessDenied(text)
HttpRequestException 404         -> context.NotFound(text)
anything else                    -> context.TransientFailure(text)
```

The receipt is call-local. Nothing durable changes. Every receipt consumer today gates on `success`, so a non-success receipt has no state effect. The category becomes visible in the pipeline's `Tool outcome category=` Information line, which today prints `Success` for a failed MCP call.

The bound-tool path (`ExecuteViaBoundToolAsync`) stays as it is. The daemon never uses it.

Positive example (observed HTTP 429 after the 30-per-minute budget):

```text
tools/call -> HTTP 429
              {"statusCode":429,"error":"Too Many Requests","message":"Rate limit exceeded, retry in 52 seconds"}
  result:  "Error: MCP tool 'shortio/get-domains' failed: Response status code does not indicate success: 429 (Too Many Requests). Response body: {"statusCode":429,...}"
  receipt: category = transient_failure
```

Positive example (observed HTTP 401 for a key with a `Bearer ` prefix the server rejects):

```text
tools/call -> HTTP 401
              {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32000,"message":"Unauthorized: No API key provided"},"id":null}
  result:  "Error: MCP tool 'shortio/get-domains' failed: ... 401 (Unauthorized) ..."
  receipt: category = access_denied
```

Negative example (observed tool-declared error; `search-links` with only its required `domainId`):

```text
tools/call -> HTTP 200
              {"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Internal Server Error"}],"isError":true},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":70}
  result:  "Error: MCP tool 'shortio/search-links' reported a failure: Internal Server Error"
  receipt: unchanged by this change
```

Alternatives:

- Let the exception reach the dispatcher's classification branch. Rejected. It changes the model-facing text, drops the tool name prefix, and reopens the `HttpClient` timeout versus caller cancellation distinction that the adapter's filter exists for.
- Return a typed result object from `IMcpToolInvoker`. Rejected. It adds a type and an interface change for one consumer.
- Map `McpProtocolException.ErrorCode == InvalidParams` to `invalid_input`. Rejected. The SDK uses that code for a malformed request or an unknown tool name, not for tool input. One more branch for an ambiguous meaning.

### D2. The manager rethrows non-transport exceptions and logs once

`McpClientManager.InvokeSharedAsync` no longer converts `McpException` to a string. The adapter is then the only converter. The tool lookup that throws `CreateUnavailableException` moves out of the `try` block, so the manager's own exception does not log as an invocation failure.

```text
try
  return InvokeFunctionAsync(...)
catch OperationCanceledException when ct.IsCancellationRequested
  rethrow                                   (no log, no reconnect)
catch Exception ex
  log Warning: server, tool, HTTP status when ex is HttpRequestException with a status, RedactForLogging(ex)
  if not IsTransportOrSessionFailure(ex): rethrow
  transportFailure = ex
reconnect for later calls; rethrow transportFailure
```

Both branches log Warning. This matters for delivery order: the #2055 pull request lands before D3, and an HTTP 500 is still a transport failure at that point. The Debug line in `ReconnectAfterTransportFailureAsync` stays.

Real log line for the 429 example above:

```text
[WRN] Netclaw.Daemon.Mcp.McpClientManager: MCP tool 'shortio/get-domains' invocation failed (HTTP 429)
```

An `HttpClient` timeout surfaces as `TaskCanceledException` with the caller token not cancelled. It logs Warning, is not a transport failure, and reaches the adapter as `transient_failure`.

The dispatcher's `Tool executed:` line stays unchanged. It reports duration and size. The Warning line is the failure signal.

Alternative: log in the adapter. Rejected. The adapter has no logger and no server context.

### D3. The classifier reads the HTTP status, on both consumers

`IsTransportOrSessionFailure` returns true for `HttpRequestException` only when `StatusCode` is null or `404`. Every other status is an application error, as the glossary defines it. The other branches of the predicate stay as they are.

Tool path: the manager rethrows an application error without a reconnect, the generation does not change, and the adapter maps it per D1.

Prompt-skill path (`LoadAsync`): today its first catch clause accepts only `McpException`. After D3 an `HttpRequestException` with an application status would match neither clause and escape to the dispatcher. The first clause widens to `McpException` or `HttpRequestException` when not a transport failure, and returns the existing `McpPromptSkillLoadResult.Failed(...)` text. No new clause, no new type.

Positive example (application error, no reconnect; observed):

```text
tools/call -> HTTP 429, body {"statusCode":429,"error":"Too Many Requests",...}
  manager:    Warning "... invocation failed (HTTP 429)"; rethrow; generation stays 1
  adapter:    transient_failure; "Error: MCP tool 'shortio/get-domains' failed: ... 429 ..."
```

Negative example (session failure, reconnect; the Streamable HTTP contract):

```text
tools/call -> HTTP 404 (session expired)
  manager:    Warning "... invocation failed (HTTP 404)"; one coalesced reconnect for later calls; rethrow
  adapter:    not_found; "Error: MCP tool 'shortio/get-domains' failed: ... 404 ..."
```

Alternative: a second predicate for application statuses. Rejected. One predicate is enough.

### D4. A 401 plus the daemon's OAuth state decides the auth remedy; header names never do

The rule, in one sentence: a 401 comes back, and the daemon either uses OAuth for that server or it does not. "Uses OAuth" is a fact the daemon holds, not a guess from configuration: `HasStoredOAuthTokens(name, entry)` (the credential store holds tokens for the server) or `IsOAuthChallenge(ex)` (the SDK turned the 401 into a Bearer-scheme `McpException`). A plain `HttpRequestException` 401 reaching Netclaw means the SDK's OAuth handler did not act, so the credential the operator configured was rejected, whatever header carries it.

All paths reuse the connect path's `CreateAuthFailedStatus`, which names `netclaw mcp auth` when `oauthManaged` is true and "Check configured credentials or headers." otherwise.

Signal 1, typed, tool call. `HttpRequestException` 401 → `MarkToolAuthFailure(name, statusText, oauthManaged: HasStoredOAuthTokens(name, entry))`. `McpException` with `IsOAuthChallenge` → `oauthManaged: true`. The alert kind follows `oauthManaged`. A 403 does not mark the server: on a tool call it means "this key cannot do that", not "this key is dead", and it stays an `access_denied` result. A stdio server has no HTTP status and is not covered.

Catalog refresh, same rule. `HasStoredOAuthTokens || IsOAuthChallenge` → `AwaitingAuth`, as today. Any other HTTP entry → `AuthFailed` with the credentials remedy.

Connect path, same rule. `BuildConnectionFailureStatus` takes `oauthChallenge` (`IsOAuthChallenge(ex)`) instead of a header-derived flag. A genuine challenge with no tokens → `AwaitingAuth`. Any other auth failure → `AuthFailed` with `oauthManaged: hasCachedTokens || oauthChallenge`. A bare 401 or 403 at `initialize` with no tokens therefore reports `AuthFailed` and the credentials remedy, where #1908 reported `Unreachable` with the HTTP status. The status text still carries the HTTP status, and no OAuth prompt appears, which was #1908's concern.

Signal 2, text. `ReportToolFailure` demotes only when `HasStoredOAuthTokens` is true, then with `oauthManaged: true`. A server without stored tokens keeps `Connected`; the Warning line still records the failure.

`CreateUnavailableException` reads the remedy from the published status message. `netclaw doctor` prints "Follow the remedy in each server's status line." and owns no scheme logic.

Header names survive in exactly two places, both collision checks: the SDK OAuth handler is not installed over an operator-configured `Authorization` header, and `netclaw mcp auth` is refused when one is configured. Neither classifies a failure.

Positive example (server that authenticates with `X-Api-Key`, no stored tokens; the key expired):

```text
http server, X-Api-Key header configured, no stored OAuth tokens
  tools/call -> HTTP 401
  result:  access_denied; "Error: MCP tool 'shortio/get-domains' failed: ... 401 (Unauthorized) ..."
  status:  AuthFailed; "Authentication rejected by server (401 Unauthorized). Check configured credentials or headers."
  next call: reconnect; a valid header restores Connected
```

Positive example (server with stored OAuth tokens, reclassified from text; the fixture in `ToolLevelAuthFailure_MovesServerOutOfConnected`):

```text
http server, daemon holds OAuth tokens for it
  tool-declared error text: "Unauthorized: token expired"
  status: AuthFailed; remedy names "netclaw mcp auth <name>"
```

Negative example (no stored tokens, same text; the old header rule would have demoted it):

```text
http server, no headers, no stored OAuth tokens
  tool-declared error text: "Unauthorized: token expired"
  status: Connected; Warning logged
```

Negative example (static-header server, not reclassified). The observed server relays its REST layer's failures as tool-declared errors with the shape `{"error":"Request failed: 404 Not Found"}` and `{"error":"Request failed: 400 Bad Request"}`. A REST 403 follows the same shape:

```text
http server, Authorization header configured (the observed shortio profile)
  tool-declared error text: {"error":"Request failed: 403 Forbidden"}
  before: IsAuthFailureMessage matches "forbidden" -> AuthFailed; false authentication_failed alert;
          "netclaw mcp auth shortio" named as the remedy, which a static-header server cannot use
  after:  status Connected; Warning logged; no remedy names "netclaw mcp auth"
```

Alternative: delete the result-text heuristic. Rejected. The expired-token case is real and has a test. A false positive on a server with stored tokens is a separate issue.

Alternative: classify by header names (an `Authorization` header present or absent). Rejected in review. A server can authenticate with any header name, so the presence of one specific name proves nothing about OAuth. The daemon's token state and the failure shape are the facts.

Alternative: demote only servers with stored tokens, on any signal. Rejected. A static credential with an expiry would then fail every call while `netclaw mcp list` reported `Connected`.

Alternative: also mark the server on a typed 403. Rejected. A 403 on one tool is usually per-resource authorization, not a dead credential.

Negative example (static-header server, typed 403):

```text
http server, Authorization header configured
  tools/call -> HTTP 403
  result:  access_denied; "Error: MCP tool '...' failed: ... 403 (Forbidden) ..."
  status:  Connected (unchanged)
```

### D5. Owners and data lifetime

| Decision | Owner | Data |
|---|---|---|
| Outcome category for an MCP exception | `McpToolAdapter` | call-local |
| Tool receipt storage | `DispatchingToolExecutor` via `ToolExecutionOutputs` | call-local |
| Reconnect or not | `McpClientManager.IsTransportOrSessionFailure` | call-local |
| Warning log line | `McpClientManager.InvokeSharedAsync` | call-local |
| Prompt load failure result | `McpClientManager.LoadAsync` | call-local |
| Server status change from result text | `McpClientManager.ReportToolFailure` | actor-local snapshot |
| Server status change from HTTP 401 | `McpClientManager.InvokeSharedAsync` via `CreateAuthFailedStatus` | actor-local snapshot |
| "Uses OAuth" decision | `McpClientManager.HasStoredOAuthTokens`, `IsOAuthChallenge` | reads the durable token store; call-local result |

No durable record, event, snapshot, protobuf, configuration, or public API changes.

## Failure modes and recovery

This pseudocode is schematic. It omits the ACL gate and redaction.

```text
transport or session failure (no status, 404, socket fault)
  -> Warning log -> at most one coalesced reconnect for later calls -> rethrow
  -> adapter: transient_failure (404: not_found) -> result string

reconnect also fails
  -> Warning log -> existing Error log -> AggregateException rethrown
  -> adapter: transient_failure -> result string

application error, HTTP status (5xx, 429, 403, other 4xx)
  -> Warning log -> rethrow, no reconnect, generation unchanged
  -> adapter: category per D1 -> result string

application error, HTTP 401 (rejected credential)
  -> Warning log -> server AuthFailed; remedy from the OAuth token state -> rethrow, no reconnect
  -> adapter: access_denied -> result string
  -> next call reconnects; the connect path classifies the same 401 the same way

application error, JSON-RPC (McpException, not session-related)
  -> Warning log -> rethrow, no reconnect
  -> adapter: transient_failure -> result string

tool-declared error (isError: true)
  -> ReportToolFailure Warning -> result string; D4 gate decides AuthFailed (unchanged otherwise)

prompt load, application error
  -> failed load result that names the prompt; no reconnect

caller cancellation
  -> propagates; no log, no receipt, no reconnect (unchanged)

HttpClient timeout (TaskCanceledException, caller token not cancelled)
  -> Warning log -> rethrow, no reconnect -> adapter: transient_failure
```

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Servers with stored OAuth tokens keep substring auth detection on result text] → Documented in D4. A false positive on such a server gets its own issue.
- [A bare 401 or 403 at `initialize` now reports `AuthFailed`, not `Unreachable`] → The message still names the HTTP status, and the remedy names credentials or headers, never `netclaw mcp auth`. #1908's dead-end prompt cannot return.
- [Tests that assert the manager returns an error string for `McpException`] → `McpClientManagerLifecycleTests` (the `application MCP failure` assertion) changes to expect the exception. The adapter test asserts the string.
- [The existing expired-token test uses a stdio entry] → It changes to an HTTP entry with stored OAuth tokens, so it keeps its meaning under D4.
- [One Warning per failed call on a flapping server] → Same volume as the tool-declared error path today. Acceptable.
- [401 or 403 on a server with stored tokens maps to `access_denied`] → The SDK refreshes inside the call. A surfaced 401 means refresh failed. `access_denied` is accurate.
- [An HTTP 401 on one tool marks the whole server `AuthFailed`] → The next call reconnects. A valid header restores `Connected` on that call. An expired header fails `initialize` with the same 401 and keeps the same status. While the header stays dead, each call costs one reconnect attempt (about five requests) and one alert; the webhook service dedupes one alert type for 300 s. Before this change such a server stayed `Connected` with one request per call and no alert. Accepted for MVP. A minimum reconnect interval for `AuthFailed` is a follow-up if the cost shows up.
- [A non-compliant server reports a dead session with HTTP 400, not 404] → The observed server answers a stale or deleted session with `HTTP 400 {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32000,"message":"Bad Request: No valid session ID provided"},"id":null}`. The SDK turns a 400 with a JSON-RPC body into `McpProtocolException`, and the predicate's message check does not read that text as a session failure. Such a server keeps a dead session until the daemon restarts. This is pre-existing: before this change the same answer was a string result with no reconnect. Out of scope here; a follow-up can add a session-scoped check for that message shape.
- [Sub-issue text changed] → #2056 drops `Retry-After`; #2057 keeps the text heuristic only for servers with stored OAuth tokens and adds the typed 401 signal on every path. The issues were edited to match, and the pull requests say so.
