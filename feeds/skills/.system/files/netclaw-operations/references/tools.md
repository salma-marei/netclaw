# Tool Discovery


## Tool Discovery


Deferred tools are not loaded by default. Load a known exact name directly:

```
load_tool(name: "notion/search")
```

Use `search_tools` when the exact name is unknown:

```
search_tools(query: "servers")                  # list all MCP servers
search_tools(query: "all", server: "notion")    # browse a server's tools
search_tools(query: "email")                    # keyword search
```

After discovery, call `load_tool` with the selected exact name. Loading exposes
the schema for the current actor. Normal authorization still runs at dispatch.

### MCP server state and concurrent callers

One configured MCP server is one daemon-owned client connection. Local STDIO
servers therefore run as one process shared by every session authorized to use
that server; a Slack thread or subagent does not receive a private MCP process.
State held by the server is shared too.

Netclaw listens for tool and prompt catalog changes when the server supports
them. Modern servers use `subscriptions/listen`. Older servers can send direct
list-change notifications when they declare `listChanged` support.

Netclaw still polls each catalog. The poll repairs missed events and supports
servers without notifications. A failed notification refresh keeps the last
good catalog. Check the daemon logs for the selected compatibility mode,
acknowledgement timeouts, unsupported methods, or an ended notification stream.

Resource discovery and resource subscriptions are not part of this behavior.

For Playwright, inspect the existing tabs before acting, create a new tab for
your work, and close only tabs you created. Tabs help callers coordinate, but
they are not security boundaries: cookies, local storage, permissions, and
other browser-context state may be shared. Do not assume another authorized
session's browser activity is private from yours.

Sessions receive granted tool categories. `builtin` is always granted.
Other categories (`web`, `file`, `shell`, `scheduling`) depend on ACL
config. If a tool is missing, it may not be granted for this session.

Built-in tool grants follow the audience and are monotonic (Public ⊆ Team ⊆
Personal). **Public parent sessions** get read-only file tools only — `file_read`,
`file_list`, and file delivery — with no outbound web access. Subagents return
authorized file paths to their parent instead of delivering files. **Team** adds
`file_write`, `file_edit`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, the scheduling tools,
`skill_manage`, and `set_working_directory`. **Personal** gets everything.
`shell_execute` is Personal-only — in a Team or Public session, use `file_list`
to enumerate a directory instead of `ls`.

Tools belonging to disabled subsystems (see [Feature Kill Switches](#feature-kill-switches))
are hidden from `search_tools` results for all audiences. Public sessions
additionally cannot discover or load skills, subagents, memory tools,
scheduling tools, or the `web_search` / `web_fetch` tools regardless of
feature flags.

### Add MCP servers

`netclaw mcp add` writes an approval default for each audience.
The command writes closed tool grants for the Team and Public audiences.

| Audience | Grants | Approval default |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Personal | Not used (`All` MCP server mode) | `Auto` |
| Team     | `[]` | `Approval` |
| Public   | `[]` | `Deny` |

After `mcp add`, the operator uses `netclaw mcp permissions` — an
interactive TUI — to grant specific tools and adjust the per-tool or
per-server approval mode. Bare `netclaw mcp tools` is a read-only CLI view
of the same state; both commands surface a discoverability hint toward the
TUI.

The `--grant-all` option skips the closed grants for Team and Public.
The option does not change the approval defaults.

Inside the TUI (`netclaw mcp permissions`):

- `Enter` toggles the highlighted tool. In the `All` MCP server mode, the toggle sets
  `Deny` (disabled) or clears it (inherit the server default). In `Allowlist`
  mode, it adds or removes the tool from the grant list.
- `A` toggles all tools on/off for the current audience
- `E` enables/disables the whole server for the current audience
- `M` cycles the **server default** approval mode (`Auto → Approval → Deny → Auto`)
- `P` cycles the **highlighted tool's explicit override** (`inherit → Auto → Approval → Deny → inherit`) — `inherit` removes any explicit override so the tool inherits the server default
- `S` saves pending changes to `netclaw.json`
- `←/→` cycles the selected audience

Approval-mode resolution precedence (for MCP tools):

1. Exact `ToolOverrides["{server}/{tool}"]` override
2. `McpServerDefaults[{server}]` default
3. Audience `DefaultMode`

A tool with an effective `Deny` mode does not appear in the model tool list.

The MCP server mode controls tool grants:

- `All` does not use `McpServerToolGrants`.
- A new tool inherits the server approval default in the `All` mode.
- `Allowlist` applies `McpServerToolGrants` when the server has an entry.
- An absent server entry adds no per-tool filter.
- Within the approval policy, an exact tool override wins over the server default.

Use `--revoke` to write a `Deny` override in the `All` mode.
Use `--grant` to remove a `Deny` override or enable a tool above a `Deny` default.

### MCP servers in old configurations

Servers added to `netclaw.json` before this behavior shipped stay untouched —
their tool grants, `ApprovalPolicy.McpServerDefaults`, and `ToolOverrides`
entries are not rewritten during an upgrade.

An existing grant snapshot has no effect when its audience uses the `All` mode.
The update does not remove or replace any exact tool override.

`netclaw doctor` will emit a warning for each enabled MCP server that
Personal can reach (`McpServersMode = All`) but has no
`ApprovalPolicy.McpServerDefaults[server]` entry and no `notion/*`-style
`ToolOverrides` entry. The warning points at `netclaw mcp permissions`.

To resolve: run `netclaw mcp permissions`, pick the server, switch to the
Personal audience, press `M` to set a server default (`Approval` is the
safe choice), `S` to save, then restart the daemon. Repeat for each
audience you want to tighten. `doctor` stops warning once the default is
set.

### When an MCP tool fails

A failed MCP tool call returns a plain, attributed error string — not a raw
JSON blob — so you can act on it directly:

- `Error: MCP tool 'server/tool' reported a failure: <detail>` — the **server**
  rejected the call (e.g. bad arguments, `old_string not found`). The detail is
  the server's own message; fix the arguments and retry, or pick a different
  tool. This is a tool-level error, not a netclaw or "tool not loaded" problem.
- `Error: MCP tool 'server/tool' failed: <detail>` — the call could not reach
  the server (transport/connection failure). Check the server's health with
  `netclaw mcp status`; a reconnect is attempted automatically once.

Both name the server explicitly (`server/tool`), so when two servers expose a
same-named tool you can tell which one failed.
