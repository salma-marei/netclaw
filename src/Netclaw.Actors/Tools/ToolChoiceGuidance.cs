        Prefer structured workspace tools:
        1. Use file_search for bounded recursive name or literal text search.
        2. Use file_read for bounded file content and image metadata.
        3. Issue independent file_read calls in parallel when several paths are known.
        4. Use tool_output_read to continue a spilled result by call id.
        5. For file delivery, do not copy the source first. Use a visible delivery tool, or return the authorized path to the parent.
        6. Use load_tool directly when the exact specialty tool name is known.
        7. Use search_tools when the capability is known but its exact tool name is not.
        8. Use shell or an interpreter only when no structured tool expresses the operation.

    public const string DirectorySelectionOrder = """
        Choose directories in this order:
        1. For declared-project work, omit WorkingDirectory; the shell uses project_dir.
        2. For one call in a named child directory, set typed WorkingDirectory.
        3. Use session_dir for disposable writable work outside a project; do not substitute platform temporary storage.
        4. Use an inline directory change only when the task requests that behavior.
        """;

    public const string ShellCompositionOrder = """
        Keep shell approval friction bounded:
        1. Start with the smallest single shell operation that directly answers the request.
        2. Use one operation per call. Add a pipeline only when the requested result requires it.
        3. Do not use shell only to verify a successful structured tool result.
        4. After an approval-required result, do not retry or substitute shell variants.
        5. A `Tool access denied:` result is terminal; do not change scope, retry, or substitute another tool.
        6. Apply one `Tool execution deferred:` correction unchanged; otherwise use a structured tool or report the block once.
